## Usage & Limits

### How Usage is Tracked

Ella counts the **number of words** in each transcription:

| What Counts | What Doesn't Count |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Transcribed words | Cancelled dictations |
| Punctuation (minimal) | Deleted transcriptions |
| Numbers | Partial transcriptions |

<Note>
  A "word" is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces. "Hello, world!" counts as 2 words.
</Note>

### Basic Plan Word Limit

- **Weekly limit**: 3,000 words
- **Reset time**: Sunday at midnight (your local time)
- **Rollover**: Unused words do NOT roll over

3,000 words per week is enough for most casual users — about 30 average-length emails or 100+ short messages.
