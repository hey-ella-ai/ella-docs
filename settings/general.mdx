## Hotkeys

Configure the keyboard shortcuts that activate Ella's dictation.

### Push to Talk Hotkey

The primary hotkey for dictation. Hold this key while speaking, then release to stop recording and insert your transcription.

**Default**: Right Option (⌥)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Record">
    In the Hotkey section, click the **Push to Talk** field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Press Your Key">
    Press your desired key or key combination.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    The new hotkey is saved automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hands-Free Mode Hotkey

An alternative hotkey for toggle-style dictation. Press once to start recording, press again to stop.

**Default**: Not set

<Note>
  Hands-Free Mode is useful for longer dictations where holding a key would be tiring.
</Note>

### Accessibility Permission

Ella requires Accessibility permission on macOS to register global hotkeys that work in any application.

If hotkeys aren't working:

1. Check the permission status in General settings
2. Click **Grant Permission** if prompted
3. Or manually enable in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**

<Warning>
  Without Accessibility permission, Ella's hotkeys will only work when the Ella window is focused.
</Warning>

## Audio & Microphone

Configure your audio input settings for optimal transcription quality.

### Preferred Microphone

Select which microphone Ella uses for dictation.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Auto-detect | Uses your Mac's default input device |
| Specific device | Choose a specific microphone from the dropdown |

<Tip>
  If you use an external microphone, select it specifically rather than relying on auto-detect to ensure consistent quality.
</Tip>

### Mic Boost

Automatically increases your microphone volume during recording for clearer audio capture.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Enabled | Boosts mic input level when recording |
| Disabled | Uses normal microphone levels |

<Note>
  Enable Mic Boost if your transcriptions are missing words or seem quieter than expected.
</Note>

### Lower System Audio

Automatically reduces system audio volume while recording to minimize background noise in your transcriptions.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Enabled | Lowers other app audio during dictation |
| Disabled | System audio remains unchanged |

This is helpful when you're listening to music or videos while dictating.
