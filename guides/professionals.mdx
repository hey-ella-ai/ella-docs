## Professional Communication Tips

### Maintain Your Tone

Ella captures exactly what you say. Speak as professionally as you'd write:

| Casual | Professional |
|--------|--------------|
| "Hey, got your note" | "Thank you for your message" |
| "Sounds good" | "I agree with your proposed approach" |
| "ASAP" | "At your earliest convenience" |

### Structure Your Thoughts First

Before dictating longer content, mentally outline:

1. Opening/context
2. Main points
3. Call to action/next steps
4. Closing

### Use Natural Punctuation

> "Dear Board Members comma. I'm pleased to report that our annual revenue grew by 25 percent period. This exceeds our initial projections significantly period."

## Workflow Optimization

### Morning Email Routine

1. Open inbox
2. Triage: Archive, delete, or queue for response
3. Use Ella to rapidly respond to queued emails
4. Inbox zero in 30 minutes vs. 2 hours

### Meeting Preparation

1. Dictate agenda items as you think of them
2. Capture pre-meeting thoughts
3. Draft key points you want to make

### Post-Meeting Follow-up

1. Immediately after meeting ends
2. Dictate summary and action items while fresh
3. Send follow-up emails same-day

## Best Practices for Professionals

### 1. Prepare Context Before Dictating

Have relevant information (names, numbers, dates) ready before you start.

### 2. Use Toggle Mode for Longer Content

For emails and documents over a paragraph, Toggle mode lets you think and speak naturally.

### 3. Review Before Sending

Quick proofread catches any transcription variations before important communications go out.

### 4. Batch Similar Tasks

Dictate all your emails at once, then all your meeting notes, to stay in flow.

### 5. Add Industry Terms to Dictionary

Add company names, product names, and industry jargon:

```
Q3/Q4
ROI
KPI
YoY
MoM
SaaS
B2B
P&L
EBITDA
```

## Recommended Settings

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Mode | Toggle-to-Talk |
| Hotkey | Right Option |
| VAD Sensitivity | Medium-Low |
| Sounds | Start/Stop sounds |
| History | Enabled |

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Enable start/stop sounds so you know when Ella is listening without looking at the screen.
