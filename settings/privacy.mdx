## Data Storage

All your transcription data is stored locally in a SQLite database on your Mac. Your transcriptions are never uploaded to external servers unless you explicitly share them.

| Data Type | Storage Location | Retention |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Transcriptions | Local SQLite database | Until you delete them |
| Settings | Local preferences file | Persistent |
| Usage statistics | Local + cloud sync | For quota tracking |

## Voice Data Handling

Ella processes your voice data securely:

- **During dictation**: Audio is captured and sent to our transcription service for processing
- **After transcription**: Audio is immediately discarded — we do not store recordings
- **Transcribed text**: Stored locally on your device only

<Note>
  Your voice recordings are never stored on our servers. Only the resulting text is saved locally on your Mac.
</Note>

## Analytics & Error Reporting

Ella collects minimal analytics to improve the app experience:

| Data Collected | Purpose | Contains Personal Data |
|----------------|---------|----------------------|
| App usage patterns | Improve features | No |
| Error reports | Fix bugs | No |
| Feature usage | Prioritize development | No |

<Note>
  Analytics never includes your transcription content. Only aggregate usage patterns and error information are collected to help improve Ella.
