## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transcripts not showing">
    1. Make sure you've made at least one dictation
    2. Check if transcripts are older than 90 days (they auto-delete)
    3. Restart Ella
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a specific transcription">
    1. Use the search bar with different keywords
    2. Try partial words or phrases you remember
    3. The transcription may have been deleted or expired
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Insert failed' showing on transcripts">
    This means the text was transcribed but couldn't be inserted into the application. Common causes:
    1. The cursor wasn't in a text field
    2. The application blocked text input
    3. Accessibility permission issue — check Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
  </Accordion>
