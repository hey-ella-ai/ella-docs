### Push to Talk

Push to Talk is the default mode and works like a walkie-talkie — hold the activation key while speaking, release when done.

**Default Hotkey:** `Fn`

**How It Works:**
1. **Press and hold** your Push to Talk hotkey
2. **Speak** your text naturally
3. **Release** the key to stop recording and insert text

**Best For:**
- Quick, short dictations
- Environments with background noise
- Users who want precise control over recording
- Dictating during meetings or calls

---

### Hands-Free Mode

Hands-Free Mode lets you press once to start recording and press again to stop — no need to hold the key.

**Default Hotkey:** `Ctrl + Space`

**How It Works:**
1. **Press** your Hands-Free hotkey once to start recording
2. **Speak** your text naturally
3. **Press** the hotkey again to stop recording and insert text

**Best For:**
- Longer dictations
- Reducing hand strain
- Writing lengthy documents or emails
- Users who prefer toggle controls

---

### Menu Bar

You can also start and stop recording directly from Ella's menu bar icon — no hotkey required.

**How It Works:**
1. **Click** the Ella icon in your menu bar
2. **Click** "Start Recording"
3. **Speak** your text naturally
4. **Click** "Stop Recording" (or use your Hands-Free hotkey)

**Best For:**
- When you can't remember your hotkey
- Occasional dictation without setting up hotkeys
- Testing that Ella is working correctly

<Tip>
  The menu bar option shows your Hands-Free hotkey as a shortcut hint, so you can learn it while using the menu.

### Using Caps Lock as Hotkey

  <Step title="Disable System Caps Lock">
    1. Open **System Settings** → **Keyboard**
    2. Click **Keyboard Shortcuts** → **Modifier Keys**
    3. Set Caps Lock to "No Action"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set in Ella">
    Open Ella Settings and click the hotkey badge to record Caps Lock as your hotkey.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessibility Permission

Global hotkeys require Accessibility permission to work when Ella isn't the active application.

### Granting Permission

If your hotkeys aren't working:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Find **Ella** in the list
3. Toggle it **ON**
4. Restart Ella

<Warning>
  Without Accessibility permission, hotkeys will only work when the Ella window is focused.
</Warning>

## Audio Settings

Ella includes audio optimization features to improve your dictation experience.

### Mic Boost

Automatically increases microphone volume during recording for clearer audio capture.

- **Location:** Settings → General → Mic Boost
- **Default:** On

### Lower System Audio

Automatically reduces system audio when Ella starts recording, making it easier to focus on speaking.

- **Location:** Settings → General → Lower System Audio
- **Default:** On
