## Onboarding

After launching Ella for the first time, you'll go through a quick onboarding process to personalize your experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Welcome">
    You'll see a welcome screen introducing Ella. Click **Get Started** to begin the setup process.

    {/* PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of welcome screen */}
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-start.png" alt="Ella welcome screen" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tell Us About Yourself">
    Ella asks two questions to personalize your experience:

    1. **What do you do for work?** — Select your role (e.g., Developer, Designer, Writer, etc.)
    2. **Where will you use Ella?** — Choose your primary use cases (Email, Code, Documents, Messages, AI Chat)

    {/* PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of profile setup */}
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-profile.png" alt="Profile setup screen" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      You can select multiple use cases. This helps Ella optimize for your workflow.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Privacy Commitment">
    Ella takes your privacy seriously. You'll see our commitment to:

    - **Voice never stored** — Audio is processed and immediately discarded
    - **Transcriptions stay on your device** — Your history is local only
    - **Zero cloud storage** — We can't access your dictations
    - **No AI training** — Your data is never used to train models

    {/* PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of privacy screen */}
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-privacy.png" alt="Privacy commitment screen" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    Ella needs two permissions to work properly:
    
    <Warning>
      Both permissions are required. Without microphone access, Ella can't hear you. Without accessibility access, Ella can't insert text.
    </Warning>
    
    1. **Microphone Access** — Click **Allow** when prompted, then test your mic by speaking for a moment
  
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-mic.png" alt="Permissions setup screen" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ella-mic.gif" alt="Grant Ella necessary permissions" />
    </Frame>


    2. **Accessibility Access** — Required so Ella can type text into your applications

    </Frame>
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ella-accessability.gif" alt="Grant Ella necessary permissions" />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      Without accessibility permission, Ella cannot insert text into applications. Enable it in **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**.
    </Warning>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Hotkeys">
    Set up your preferred activation shortcuts for two dictation modes:

    | Mode | Default Shortcut | How It Works |
    |------|------------------|--------------|
    | **Push-to-Talk** | `Fn` | Hold to record, release to transcribe |
    | **Hands-Free** | `Ctrl + Space` | Press once to start, press again to stop |

    {/* PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of hotkey configuration */}
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-keys.png" alt="Hotkey configuration screen" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      Click on any shortcut to customize it. You can change these later in Settings → General.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Practice Dictation">
    Try both dictation modes with interactive practice exercises:

    1. **Push-to-Talk Practice** — Hold your hotkey and dictate a response to a sample Slack message

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-test1.png" alt="Practice dictation screen" />
    </Frame>
    
    2. **Hands-Free Practice** — Toggle recording on/off while composing a sample email reply

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/onboarding-test2.png" alt="Practice dictation screen" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Note>
      Take your time with practice. This helps you get comfortable with both modes before using Ella in real applications.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your Free Trial">
    You're all set! Your **7-day free Pro trial** is automatically activated with:

    - Unlimited words
    - Optimized transcription speed
    - Smart memory features
    - Advanced formatting

    No credit card required. Click **Start Using Ella** to begin dictating.
