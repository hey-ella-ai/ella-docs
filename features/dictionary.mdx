<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Terminology" icon="book">
    Add words and phrases Ella should recognize exactly as spelled — names, brands, technical terms, and jargon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Word Replacement" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Create rules to automatically replace one word or phrase with another during transcription.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Custom Terminology

Add words that Ella might not recognize or might transcribe incorrectly. These entries teach Ella the correct spelling and capitalization.

### Why Use Custom Terminology?

- **Names** — People, companies, products, places
- **Technical terms** — Industry-specific vocabulary
- **Brand names** — Proper capitalization and spelling
- **Abbreviations** — Acronyms unique to your field
- **Foreign words** — Non-English terms you use regularly

<Tip>
  Without dictionary entries, Ella might transcribe "Nguyen" as "Win" or "Anthropic" as "and thropic".
</Tip>

### Adding a Vocabulary Word

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Dictionary">
    Click the Ella menu bar icon → **Settings** → **Dictionary** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Entry">
    Click the **Add New** button.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click the green checkmark to save. The entry is active immediately.

### Examples

| Entry | Why Add It |

| `açaí` | Foreign word with special characters |
| `McKinsey` | Unusual capitalization |
| `HIPAA` | Acronym that should stay uppercase |
| `Figma` | Product name |

## Word Replacement

Create rules to automatically replace words or phrases during transcription. This is useful for expanding abbreviations, correcting common mistakes, or using shorthand.

### Why Use Word Replacement?

- **Expand abbreviations** — Say "BRB" and get "be right back"
- **Use shorthand** — Say "sig" and get your full signature
- **Auto-correct** — Fix words you commonly misspeak
- **Formatting** — Replace spoken versions with formatted text

### Adding a Replacement Rule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Dictionary">
    Click the Ella menu bar icon → **Settings** → **Dictionary** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Entry">
    Click the **Add New** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Replacement">
    Check the **"This is a replacement rule"** checkbox.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Original and Replacement">
    Two fields appear:
    - **Original word** — What you'll say
    - **Replacement** — What Ella will type

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/word-replacement.png" alt="Entering a replacement rule" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click the green checkmark to save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

| Original | Replacement | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `BRB` | `be right back` | Expand abbreviation |
| `sig` | `Best regards, Sarah Mitchell` | Quick signature |
| `addr` | `742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield` | Address shorthand |
| `myemail` | `sarah.mitchell@company.com` | Email shorthand |
| `teh` | `the` | Auto-correct typo |
| `dont` | `don't` | Add punctuation |

<Tip>
  Replacement rules are powerful for creating shortcuts. Say a short trigger word and get a full phrase, address, or signature inserted.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### For Custom Terminology

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="check">
    - Use exact capitalization: `PostgreSQL` not `postgresql`
    - Add names as people spell them: `Siobhan`, `Björk`
    - Include company names: `Shopify`, `Atlassian`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid" icon="xmark">
    - Common words that transcribe fine already
    - Multiple variations of the same word
    - Very long phrases (use replacement rules instead)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### For Replacement Rules

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="check">
    - Use short, memorable trigger words
    - Create rules for frequently typed text
    - Use unique triggers that won't occur naturally
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid" icon="xmark">
    - Trigger words you use in normal speech
    - Overly complex replacement text
    - Rules that conflict with each other
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
